// Howdy! This file contains unverified endpoints so they may need touching up.
// Sorry for the mess, I just don't have the time to verify everything by hand,
// especially with the volatile nature of a live service like Discord. If
// something doesn't work come swing by #ðŸ”šendpoints on the Discord++ server and
// someone'll help you out! If the endpoints work fine swing by that same
// channel with proof of credit for the @Endpoint Verifier role!
